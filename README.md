# solaredge_setapp

solaredge_setapp is a python library that parses inverter and power optimizer data from a compatible SolarEdge PV inverter. Only those models which support SetApp commissioning are supported.

This project is built on the efforts of others: for Home Assistant users, see drobstravels' <a href="https://github.com/drobstravels/solaredge_local">solaredge_local</a>, and jbuehl's <a href="https://github.com/jbuehl/solaredge">solaredge</a> for all non-SetApp power inverters.
